# CircleButtonToHeader
Simple animation of a button expanding to become the header of another view controller

First controller need to implement `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`

Customization can be done in `ToTopRoundedTransition.swift` like color, time transition, changing offset, etc ... 

Higly inspired by FranceInfo app commentary button behavior.
